     * <p>
     * First we disable dithering, then we use the method {@code glHint} to set the implementation
     * specific hint GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT to GL_FASTEST. We set the red, green, blue, and
     * alpha values used when the color buffers are cleared to (0.5,0.5,0.5,1.0) (GRAY), set the

     * texture to the texturing target GL_TEXTURE_2D (While a texture is bound, GL operations on the

     * is bound return state from the bound texture. In effect, the texture targets become aliases
     * for the textures currently bound to them, and the texture name zero refers to the default
     * textures that were bound to them at initialization.)

     * GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER set to GL_NEAREST (The texture minifying function used whenever
     * the level-of-detail function used when sampling from the texture determines that the
     * texture should be minified: GL_NEAREST Returns the value of the texture element that
     * is nearest (in Manhattan distance) to the specified texture coordinates.)
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER set to GL_LINEAR (The texture magnification function is used
     * whenever the level-of-detail function used when sampling from the texture determines
     * that the texture should be magnified: GL_LINEAR Returns the weighted average of the
     * texture elements that are closest to the specified texture coordinates.)
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S set to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE (Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate s to
     * GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE: causes s coordinates to be clamped to the range [1/2N,1âˆ’1/2N], where N is
     * the size of the texture in the direction of clamping)
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T set to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE (Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate t to
     * GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE: see the discussion under GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S)
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * Then we set the target texture environment GL_TEXTURE_ENV texture environment parameter
     * GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE to the texture function GL_REPLACE. Finally we call the {@code load}
     * method of our field {@code TextureLoader mTextureLoader} to load the texture image.

         * rendering (3 coordinates per vertex, GL_FLOAT as the data type of each coordinate, 0 as
         * the stride between vertices (no extra data contained between vertices), and
         * {@code FloatBuffer mFVertexBuffer} as the pointer to the first coordinate of the first
         * vertex in the array.
         * <p>
         * Next we enable the GL_TEXTURE_2D server-side GL capability (If enabled and no fragment
         * shader is active, two-dimensional texturing is performed (unless three-dimensional or
         * cube-mapped texturing is also enabled), and we use {@code glTexCoordPointer} to define an
         * array of texture coordinates with 2 coordinates per array element, GL_FLOAT as the data
         * type, 0 as the byte offset between consecutive texture coordinate sets. and
         * {@code FloatBuffer mTexBuffer} as the pointer to the first coordinate of the first
         * vertex in the array.
         * <p>
         * Finally we call {@code glDrawElements} to render primitives from our array data, using
         * the primitive type GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, VERTS (3) elements to be rendered, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT
         * as the type of the values in our indices buffer, and {@code ShortBuffer mIndexBuffer} as
